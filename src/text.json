    "summary": "The POC-1 was built as a test engine to gain experience designing, building and operating a rocket propulsion system. This engine is not intended to fly as it uses a water cooling system. The cooling system is design as a regen system, but the flow rates required exceed that of the fuel system necessitating and external coolant supply.",
    "engineAssembly": {
      "summary": "POC-1's primary design philosophies were cost and simplicity of manufacturing. Coming up with the initial geometry of the engine based on some specs with software like RPA is pretty easy, then you have to figure out how to make it. A combustion chamber is an inherently difficult to machine part. It usually requires a CNC lathe with considerable bore depths. We ordered our chamber from Proto Labs and it was made in China and came back with a very rough surface on converging nozzle, This required significant man hours to polish out otherwise we would have experienced flow losses and greater heat transfer at the throat.",
      "combustionChamber": "Our combustion chamber and our injector were made from low carbon 1018 steel for weldability, ease of machine and cost.",
      "warmFire": "After we had the injector assembled, the combustion chamber and the coolant jacket were still very long lead time items so we decided to perform a \"Warm Fire\" with as fuel only injector to test it out along with our test stand, it primarily acted as schedule driver to get hardware, software and electric in functional shape. After warm fire we decided to completely rebuild the electrical system and we learned a lot about the stand and the logistics of getting the massive stand to the test site.",
      "postWarmFire": "After warm fire we attempted some quick turn combustion chamber ideas while waiting for the real chamber explored here if you want to learn ways NOT to make a combustion chamber: ",
      "waterJacket1": "One of the trickiest parts of small scale rocket engine development is the regen cooling system. If making a combustion chamber wasn't hard enough now you have to get a pressure vessel around that. That requires something that either splits with a weld or bolts with a fancy sealing mechanism or have it slide into a bore with an insert in the throat region.",
      "waterJacket2": "We went with a straight bore and insert method. The main jacket is aluminum with a deep straight bore, the part doesn't seem too complex but the long bore non-trivial to turn on a lathe.",
      "coolingInsert": "For our cooling insert due to the complex geometry we used a SLA printed Nylon we got discounted from GoProto. This made it far cheaper than going with a machined part and works well since the part is low load and isn't in too high of a temperature environment. The parts used brass inserts installed with a soldering iron mounted to a drill press and laser cut gasket.",
      "edmFilmCoolingOrifices": "In-order for the throat not to melt regen cooled engines gernally require film cooling just upstream of the throat. This requires injecting fuel/coolant from the regen system into the chamber at a known flow rate. If too much is injected it won't get combusted and will lower ISP, too little and the engine melts. We optimally would have had 0.010\" holes but the smallest we could get were 8x 0.015\" holes. To make holes this small especially at crazy angles usually requires EDM. We used Applegate EDM and it cost us $500 for the 8 holes (more than we paid for the chamber it's self).",

      "hardware": "We initially started with an Arduino to control our stand and quickly reached its limits and moved to an ARM board. This allowed us to have dedicated much higher precision  ADC (analog-to-digital) converter. To achieve a 1khz data rate on all our sensors with 12 bit values ended up being pretty challenging, I wouldn't recommend it without a strong electrical engineer on the team. It's an order of magnitude more challenging than an Arduino project like the vertical integrator avionics.",
      "groundStation": "If you want a high data rate, don't make a GUI in MATLAB it's far too slow. At 1kHz data rate the serial read method takes half the cycle time."

          "Considering the pneumatic cylinder was double-acting, meaning the cylinder opens and closes with compressed air. Therefore, if the spring could not close the valve on its' own, the pneumatic cylinder would close the valve the rest of the way."

      },
      "valveMounts": "After selecting the best actuation design for the valve, I had to design mounts to secure the valves on the test stand. Initially, I 3D printed valve mounts that used the hex feature of the valve to prevent rotation and secure the valve in place. Unfortunately, as the technicians tried to torque fittings on the inlet and outlet of the valves, they would apply so much force on my mounts that they mount would break. This happened constantly.",
      "finalProduct": "After testing, it was concluded that the first design was the most cost effective, compact, easy to assemble, and simplest design. With the pneumatic cylinder that it was strong enough even at 30 psi to close the valve without any stalling issues. It was also noted that the position of the pneumatic valve with relation to the valve handle was very important as to not stall when opening and closing the valve."

    "summary1": "This engine has its roots in practicing aluminum fuel tank welds, I had been welding some simple test vessels to hydro statically test and realized I could probably turn them into rocket engines. So I did a lot of reading on Richard Nakka's excellent rocket website ",
    "summary2": " and got to work designing my own solid rocket engine. I would not recommend using aluminum for an engine you want to fire many times. However, only having a small G0765 Grizzly 7\" x 14\" Mini lathe, steel turning was outside my capabilities. Aluminum is easy and fast to machine but will erode with multiple firings.",
    "staticFire1": "In this static fire the engine performed far lower than analytically predicted by METEOR, and took far to long to come up to full thrust. We addressed this by incrasing the amount of black powder in the ignitor, adding slits to the side of the straw ignitor and hot gluing the throat of the engine. This allowed pressure to build in the chamber and combustion to spread before the ignitor was ejected.",
    "staticFire2": "The second static fire demonstrated much better ramp up time with the new ignitor. The exterior of the engine was also machined down for weight savings. Unfortunately the thrust tester was not zip tied to the test stand and thus no thrust curve was able to be generated with the new ignitor design, and the next test was the maiden flight of the Vertical Integrator.",
    "throatErosion": "As expected after multiple firings the aluminum throat started to erode. So while aluminum engines are easy to make they don't last many firings. This issues was likely exasperated by the step on the inside of the throat. Due to poor machining of the nozzle by the author instead of a the cones meeting at a smooth point, the converging nozzle hits a flat with a thin sharp wall to the expanding nozzle on the other side. This also explains the lower than expected performance.",
    "propellantManufacturing": {
      "summary": "We primarily followed the procedure outlined on Richard Nakka's site: ",
      "step1": "Dextrose was ground in the mortar pestle then baked for an hour in the oven at 175F for 1 hour to remove the water content.",
      "step2": "While Stump remover was run through a coarse sieve to remove chunks and then ground in mortar pestle.",
      "step3": "After baking the dextrose will form chunks and needs to be ground back to a powder with a mortar pestle.",
      "step4": "The ratios can then be confirmed, an extra 9% of dextrose needs to be put in the oven to account for the water being baked out. Final ratio should be 65% Potassium Nitrate and 35% Dextrose for optimal performance. This mix needs to be  thoroughly mixed, for this we used a protein shake bottle with mixer ball.",
      "step5": "We then heated a skillet to 135-145C on an electric stove, using a heat gun and constant tuning of the heat setting. Propellant was added steadily added as existing propellant melted stirring until all propellant was added and mixed. Unlike Nakka we were able to get a very pourable mixture.",
      "step6": "Propellant was poured into 3D printed molds. PLA was not a good choice for the center post as it softened and tilted as propellant was poured. It was later replaced with a partial threaded rod from McMaster. Due to the stickiness of the propellant and the roughness of 3D prints the upper section of the mold was simply removed with a hacksaw after the propellant was allowed to dry.",
      "step7": "Propellant is then ready to be loaded into the engine or stored in an air tight container.",
      "step8": "If there are issues with in fitting into the engine (such as too much penetration on the weld) we found an effective strategy to get the propellant is was to plug the nozzle with plastic wrap with a few layers then dunk in boiling water. The propellant can then easily be squeezed in.",
      "step9": "To aid combustion speed in our second batch we poured black powder through the center bore of the propellant grain."

  "verticalIntegrator": {
    "summary": "The vertical integrator was a build to rapidly develop a full stack rocket from scratch to gain competency and experience in flight vehicle design before scaling up to a bi-propellant liquid rocket. The rocket was designed and built in 3 weeks with no purchased off the shelf rocket parts. The engine and recovery was inspired by Richard Nakka's website ---, the avionics was optimized for ease of interfacing with minimal time spent in firmware development. The rocket was designed to be modular with mostly 3D printed components to allow rapid iteration and repair.",
    "designed": "The rocket was designed in SolidWorks with stability and trajectory analysis done in Open Rocket.",
    "flight1": "Flight #1 successfully demonstrated rocket stability, successful ignition and partial functionality of avionics. Recovery failed to deploy which is attributed to a yet un-discovered software bug and the incorrect manually recovery signal was sent (caps-lock caused the wrong P to be sent over serial, room for usability improvements here). Data logging while slow (from long barometer poll time) was functional, barometer seems to be thrown off by engine exhaust during ascent burn.",
    "recovery": {
      "inspired": "Parachute assembly photos, etc. inspired by Richard Nakka",
      "parachute": "For our parachute we went with a semi-ellipsoid design based off Richard Nakka's design with Dragon/Apollo capsule colors. The manufacturing is not complex, but is very time consuming in both hand stitching and machine stitching. With a single stage recovery system we had to trade between impact velocity and horizontal drift. The fins on this rocket were designed to be easily replaceable and thus we priorities minimizing horizontal drift of impact speeds to necessitate a smaller launch site.",
      "gores": "Gores were cut from rip stop nylon using printed flat patterns. The edges are hemmed and then sewed to a binding (not to the other gores) to allow for proper shape at deployment. The parachute is then connected to the rocket using braided Kevlar line.",
      "deployment": "The next challenge was deployment, we used a (home-brew) black powder charge of ground natural charcoal (not briquets with clay) and potassium nitrate loaded into a hot glue sealed straw. Embedded in the powder is a 38 AWG nichrome wire powered by a 9v on a relay circuit, we initially tried to get the 24 AWG nichrome used for lighting the liquid to work with a 9v, but it's doesn't have sufficient power output.",
      "gas": "With enough pressurized gas being generated by the black powder charge we needed a way to contain it an use it to force out the parachute. In initial testing we would fire the ignitor and a puff of smoke would come out, but no parachute. We determined that with 3D printer tolerances our plunger was able to spin in the bore and leak the gas out. It fix this we increased the L/D of the plunger and reduced the points of contact to just two ridges. This reduced friction while also making it easy print the ridges over sized and sand them to the desired fit."

    "avionics": {
      "summary": "The primary goal of Vertical Integrators Avionics system was ease of programing. The IMU and altimeter purchased do all the math for you and are ease to read on I2C. This however comes at the expense of being very slow, the altimeter take 400 ms to poll in it's factory setup which with a simple Arduino loop severely limits your overall data rate. This can be solved by setting some registry bits or by changing the library methods, but this wasn't done before the first flight."

  "nitrousOxide": {
    "afterStaticFire1": "After static firing POC-1 with gaseous oxygen, the team wanted to move toward a more flight weight design. The first plan was to use hydrogen peroxide. Hydrogen peroxide on paper is an amazing propellant, you can take it from an easy mono propellant to respectable ISP with a little added fuel. However, sourcing the propellant affordably is quite challenging. FrontierAstronautics.com will sell you propellent grade HTP at $30 a pound, but when you consider the engine consumes over a pounds per second, long duration static fires quickly add up. Then you have to source a considerable amount of silver mesh as the catalyst. Distilling your own HTP seems like a good idea at first but is impractical at any reasonable scale and very dangerous. Many small labs have blown them selves up refining it and any one who has worked with it recommends against distilling your self.",
    "afterHydrogenPeroxide": "After realizing that hydrogen peroxide was going to impractical we looked at other storable oxidizers that would be easier to use than Lox. N2O is extremely easy to use an source, any race shop around can fill your tank and you can store it at room temperature. This storability and self pressurizing nature is what makes it so popular with hybrid rockets. The performance and effective density are obviously not as good as LOx due to the extra nitrogen you are lugging around. Regenerative cooling also becomes a challenge as your fuel flow rates are very low.",
    "co2": "Currently we are experimenting with CO2 as it has similar two-phase properties to N20 will being much cheaper, easy to source and less dangerous. We will use CO2 to test our venturi and validate our back flow chamber set up where we will attempt to keep the chamber pressure at 300 psi using a throttle valve."
